MASK SWAP — STORYLINE
=====================
Theme: Mask | Social cause: Access and identity | Use this for in-game text, store page, and jam pitch.

----------------------------------------
1. PREMISE
----------------------------------------

You are an infiltrator. You don't belong here — not by their rules. This place only lets in the right face. So you wear it.

You steal masks from those who have access. Guard, Scientist, Janitor. Each mask opens doors that stay closed to everyone else. Wrong mask = no access. No questions asked.

You're not here to destroy. You're here to reach someone — or something — that's been kept behind who you're allowed to be.

----------------------------------------
2. SETTING
----------------------------------------

THE FACILITY
  A closed system. Elite institution, corporate campus, or gated research complex. In India, or anywhere such places exist: guarded gates, "Authorised personnel only," clear hierarchy. Guards at the door. Scientists in the labs. Janitors in the corridors nobody notices.

  The player infers: this place is for "the right people." Everyone else is kept out — or let in only when they look the part.

NO EXPLICIT REAL-WORLD LABELS
  Don't name castes, religions, or communities. The facility and the masks are fictional. The theme (access, identity, "right face") does the work.

----------------------------------------
3. MOTIVE (WHY YOU'RE HERE)
----------------------------------------

Pick one, or keep it vague. One line at start is enough.

OPTION A — RESCUE
  They took someone from you. A family member, a friend. This facility holds them — or holds the key to where they are. You're here to get them out.

OPTION B — PROOF
  Something here could change your life — or someone else's. Evidence. A document. A truth. The door is closed to you. So you wear the face that opens it.

OPTION C — SURVIVAL
  You need what's inside. Medicine. Money. A chance. They only let in the right face. So you wear it.

OPTION D — VAGUE (RECOMMENDED FOR 48H)
  You're here for a reason. They don't care. They only care that you look like you belong. So you wear the face that opens the door.

----------------------------------------
4. OPENING (START OF GAME)
----------------------------------------

Use one screen. One to three sentences. Then gameplay.

RECOMMENDED OPENING TEXT
  "They only let in the right face. So you wear it. Get in. Reach what you came for. Get out."

ALTERNATIVE (LONGER)
  "This place doesn't let you in. Not as you are. They only open the door for the right face — Guard, Scientist, the ones who belong. So you take that face. You get in. You reach what you came for. You get out."

ALTERNATIVE (SOCIAL-CAUSE FRAMING)
  "Access depends on the mask you wear. Here, that's literal. Get in. Reach what you came for. Get out."

----------------------------------------
5. IN-GAME LINES (DOORS / TERMINALS / VENTS)
----------------------------------------

When the player tries the wrong mask (or no mask), show one short line. Reinforces theme without preaching.

GUARD DOOR (player has no Guard mask)
  "Authorised personnel only."
  OR "You're not on the list."
  OR "Guard clearance required."

TERMINAL (player has no Scientist mask)
  "Clearance required."
  OR "Access denied."
  OR "Authorised personnel only."

VENT (player has no Janitor mask)
  "Maintenance access only."
  OR "Authorised personnel only."

----------------------------------------
6. OPTIONAL — NPC LINE BEFORE TAKEDOWN
----------------------------------------

One NPC (e.g. Scientist or Janitor) can say one line when the player is close / about to takedown. Adds moral weight. Player can still take the mask.

EXAMPLES
  "Please — I'm not one of them. I just needed the job."
  OR "Don't. I'm not one of them. I just clean."
  OR "Please — I have a family."

Use at most one such line per level, or only once in the whole game. Keeps it from feeling preachy.

----------------------------------------
7. OPTIONAL — JANITOR MASK (INVISIBLE LABOUR)
----------------------------------------

When the player takes the Janitor mask, one short line (e.g. on screen or in UI).

  "Nobody looks at the one who cleans."

Ties "invisible" labour to the mask. No gameplay change. One line only.

----------------------------------------
8. ENDING (AFTER PLAYER REACHES OBJECTIVE)
----------------------------------------

Use one screen. One to three sentences. Then "Mission complete" or return to menu.

RECOMMENDED ENDING
  "You got in. You had to wear their face to do it. You got out. The door still only opens for the right face."

ALTERNATIVE (HOPE)
  "You reached them. You had to wear their face to do it. Next time, maybe the door opens for the face you already have."

ALTERNATIVE (MINIMAL)
  "You got in. You got out. You wore their face. Nothing else changed."

SOCIAL-CAUSE CLOSING (optional, after main ending)
  "Inspired by how often access depends on the mask we wear."
  [Optional: link to one NGO — education, mental health, or inclusion — in India or elsewhere.]

----------------------------------------
9. STORE PAGE / JAM PITCH (ONE PARAGRAPH)
----------------------------------------

"Mask Swap is a 3D stealth game about identity and access. You infiltrate a closed facility by stealing the masks of those who belong — Guard, Scientist, Janitor. Each mask opens doors that stay closed to everyone else. Wrong mask = no access. You're not here to destroy. You're here to reach what you came for. The game asks: what do we wear to get through the door? Inspired by how often access depends on the face we're allowed to show."
