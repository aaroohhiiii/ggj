PHASE 1 — DONE (FULL MAKING THE GAME)
======================================
What was built and what you need to do.

----------------------------------------
WHAT WAS CREATED
----------------------------------------

1. PROJECT SETUP
   • Main scene set to: res://levels/test_level.tscn
   • Input map added: interact (E), move_left (A), move_right (D), move_forward (W), move_back (S)

2. FOLDER STRUCTURE
   • scripts/player.gd
   • scenes/player.tscn
   • levels/test_level.tscn

3. PLAYER (scenes/player.tscn)
   • CharacterBody3D with:
	 - CollisionShape3D (capsule, radius 0.4, height 1.8)
	 - MeshInstance3D (capsule — visible placeholder)
	 - Camera3D (third-person, behind and above)
   • Script: movement (WASD), mouse look (horizontal), E = interact (placeholder print), mouse capture (Escape toggles)

4. TEST LEVEL (levels/test_level.tscn)
   • Node3D root
   • Floor: StaticBody3D with BoxShape3D + BoxMesh (20x1x20)
   • Player instance at origin

----------------------------------------
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW
----------------------------------------

1. OPEN THE PROJECT IN GODOT
   • Open Godot 4.x
   • Import or Open the project: first/ (the folder containing project.godot)
   • Let it import if prompted

2. RUN THE GAME
   • Press F5 or click Run Project (Play)
   • You should see: a grey floor, a capsule (player), camera behind you.

3. TEST
   • WASD — move
   • Mouse — look left/right (player rotates)
   • E — print in Output: "E pressed - interact (Phase 1 placeholder)"
   • Escape — release/capture mouse cursor

4. IF SOMETHING FAILS
   • Main scene: Project → Project Settings → Application → Run → Main Scene = res://levels/test_level.tscn
   • Input: Project → Project Settings → Input Map — should have interact, move_left, move_right, move_forward, move_back
   • If player falls through floor: check Floor has CollisionShape3D and Player has CollisionShape3D

----------------------------------------
NEXT: PHASE 2
----------------------------------------

Phase 2 = Mask system: current_mask variable, mask swap from body/pickup, UI (current mask), optional mesh swap on character.
See mask_swap_final_flow_and_implementation.txt Part 2 — Phase 2.
