HOW TO ADD CLOTHES TO THE CHARACTER (EXACT STEPS)
==================================================
Your character is Quaternius Superhero Male/Female. The "outfit" is painted on the body texture (one mesh, one material). To get different looks (Guard, Scientist, Janitor) you have 3 options.

----------------------------------------
OPTION 1 — RECOLOR IN GODOT (FASTEST, NO NEW ASSETS)
----------------------------------------

Use the SAME character and only change the body color in Godot. No downloads, no texture editing.

Steps:

1. Open your project in Godot.

2. Place the character in a scene:
   - FileSystem → assets/3d/characters/player/
   - Drag Superhero_Male_FullBody.gltf (or Female) into the scene tree (e.g. as child of your Player node, or into the level).

3. In the Scene tree, select the character node (the root of the imported .gltf).

4. Expand it and find the MeshInstance3D that has the body (often named like "Body" or the main mesh). Click it.

5. In the Inspector, find the Material override or the Surface Material (expand the mesh if needed). The material uses T_Superhero_Male_Dark (or Female) as Albedo texture.

6. Duplicate the material so you can edit it:
   - Click the material → dropdown → Duplicate (or right‑click → Duplicate).
   - You now have a copy (e.g. Superhero_Male_Dark (Material) copy).

7. Change the Albedo color:
   - In the duplicated material, find Albedo → Color (or Albedo → Texture → then add a tint).
   - If there's no color yet: Albedo → enable "Vertex Color" or add a new StandardMaterial3D, set Albedo Texture to the same T_Superhero_Male_Dark.png, then set Albedo → Color to tint (e.g. dark blue for Guard, light grey/white for Scientist).
   - Or: create a NEW StandardMaterial3D: Albedo Texture = T_Superhero_Male_Dark.png, Albedo Color = e.g. (0.2, 0.2, 0.5) for Guard, (0.9, 0.9, 0.95) for Scientist. Normal/Roughness = same as original (T_Superhero_Male_Normal.png, T_Superhero_Male_Roughness.png).

8. Save the scene. Duplicate the character node for Guard/Scientist/Janitor and assign different Albedo colors per copy (Guard = dark, Scientist = light, Janitor = e.g. grey/green).

Exact colors (suggested):
  Guard:    Albedo Color ≈ (0.15, 0.2, 0.35)  — dark blue/grey
  Scientist: Albedo Color ≈ (0.85, 0.9, 0.95) — light/white
  Janitor:  Albedo Color ≈ (0.4, 0.4, 0.45)  — grey

----------------------------------------
OPTION 2 — EDIT THE TEXTURE (DIFFERENT OUTFIT COLORS ON BODY)
----------------------------------------

Paint different shirt/body colors on the PNG so Guard/Scientist/Janitor have clearly different outfits.

Steps:

1. Open the body texture in an image editor:
   - File: first/assets/3d/characters/player/T_Superhero_Male_Dark.png (or T_Superhero_Female_Dark_BaseColor.png)

2. Use GIMP (free) or Krita (free) or Photoshop:
   - Duplicate the image; save copies as:
     T_Guard_BaseColor.png      (paint body/shirt area dark blue or black)
     T_Scientist_BaseColor.png  (paint body/shirt area white or light blue)
     T_Janitor_BaseColor.png    (paint body/shirt area grey or green)
   - Keep the same resolution and UV layout (don’t resize or crop the canvas). Only change the color of the “outfit” areas (torso, arms, legs as per the UV).

3. Put the new PNGs in the same folder:
   first/assets/3d/characters/player/

4. In Godot:
   - For each character (Guard, Scientist, Janitor), duplicate the character scene or the material.
   - In the material, set Albedo Texture to the new PNG (T_Guard_BaseColor.png etc.). Keep Normal and Roughness as the original (T_Superhero_Male_Normal.png, T_Superhero_Male_Roughness.png) unless you made new ones.

5. Save. You now have 3 outfit variants.

----------------------------------------
OPTION 3 — SEPARATE CLOTHING ASSETS (EXTRA MESHES ON TOP)
----------------------------------------

Use extra “clothing” meshes (e.g. lab coat, vest) that parent to the same character rig. Harder with Quaternius because most free clothing packs are made for Mixamo or other rigs.

Where to look (if you want to try):
  - Sketchfab: search “lab coat”, “guard uniform”, “character outfit” — filter Downloadable + Free. Check if rig is compatible (humanoid, similar bone names).
  - Mixamo: different characters have different outfits (not “clothes” you add on top). You could use one Mixamo character as Scientist (lab coat) and keep Quaternius for Guard.
  - Quaternius: https://quaternius.itch.io — check other packs (e.g. “Packs” or “Characters”) for outfit add-ons; not all fit the Universal Base rig.

For a jam, Option 1 (recolor in Godot) is enough: Guard = dark, Scientist = light, Janitor = grey. Option 2 if you want clearly different “uniform” looks without extra meshes.

----------------------------------------
SUMMARY
----------------------------------------

  Option 1: Recolor in Godot — duplicate material, change Albedo Color (Guard dark blue, Scientist light, Janitor grey). No new files.
  Option 2: Edit T_Superhero_Male_Dark.png — paint body different colors, save as T_Guard_BaseColor.png etc., assign in Godot.
  Option 3: Add separate clothing meshes — possible but need rig‑compatible assets; optional.

Use Option 1 first; add Option 2 later if you want stronger outfit differences.
