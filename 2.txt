📌 Notes for use (important)
Always check license on the asset page before using — most are free but some require attribution or restrict commercial use.
For quickest jam progression, focus first on:
Mixamo characters
Kenney 3D environment
Freesound / Kenney SFX
Kenney + FreePD music
That gives you enough to ship a polished prototype without licensing headaches.
If you want, I can also:
Generate a copy-paste credit list you can include in your game/jam submission
Suggest exact picks for each slot (e.g., specific model for Guard, door, terminal)
Or create a starter Godot project with all references linked
